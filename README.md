# scroller-2016

Snippets from a personal project I worked on between 2012-2016. 

This was an iOS app designed to take MusicXML files and draw piano notation on the screen and scroll the notes across the phone screen. It had a metronome, the ability to speed up or slow down the scrolling, and other intuitive controls such as tapping to pause/start and swiping to navigate through the song. 

There was also a complimentary 'music store' that allowed you to easily download songs from a ghetto php server i had setup with MySQL.
